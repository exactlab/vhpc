# packages.yml - Runtime package installation configuration
# 
# USAGE:
#   1. Copy this file to packages.yml 
#   2. Uncomment volume mount in docker-compose.yml:
#      - ./packages.yml:/packages.yml:ro
#   3. Customize package lists below
#   4. Start containers: docker compose up
#
# SCHEMA VALIDATION:
#   - rpm_packages, python_packages, and extra_commands are optional
#   - Each must be a list of strings
#   - Empty lists are valid
#   - Invalid package names will cause installation to fail
#   - Invalid commands will cause startup to fail

# Rocky Linux packages to install via dnf
# These packages are installed system-wide and available to all users
rpm_packages:
  - htop              

# Python packages to install via pip
# These packages are installed in the virtual environment
python_packages:
  - pydantic

# Extra commands to execute during container startup
# These commands are executed after package installation as root user
extra_commands:
  - "echo 'Custom startup command executed'"
  - "mkdir -p /tmp/custom"

# NOTES:
# - Package installation happens at container startup before Slurm services
# - Extra commands are executed after package installation
# - Failed package installations or failed extra commands will cause startup to
#   fail
# - Installation is idempotent - restarting containers is safe
# - Large packages may increase container startup time
