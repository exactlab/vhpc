# packages.yml - Runtime package installation configuration
# 
# USAGE:
#   1. Copy this file to packages.yml 
#   2. Uncomment volume mount in docker-compose.yml:
#      - ./packages.yml:/packages.yml:ro
#   3. Customize package lists below
#   4. Start containers: docker compose up
#
# SCHEMA VALIDATION:
#   - Both rpm_packages and python_packages are optional
#   - Each must be a list of strings (package names)
#   - Empty lists are valid
#   - Invalid package names will cause installation to fail

# Rocky Linux packages to install via dnf
# These packages are installed system-wide and available to all users
rpm_packages:
  - htop              

# Python packages to install via pip3
# These packages are installed globally for Python 3
python_packages:
  - pydantic

# NOTES:
# - Package installation happens at container startup before SLURM services
# - Failed package installations will be logged but won't prevent startup
# - Packages are installed with timeout protection (5 minutes max)
# - Installation is idempotent - restarting containers is safe
# - Large packages may increase container startup time
